# loguin-metods2

This repository, called “login-methods2”, is a more developed continuation of the previous project “login-methods”, both developed as part of the Integrator course work at the university. Although similar to the previous project, this second part focuses on a more elaborate design and implementation of additional functionality to further explore authentication and login methods, both client-side and server-side.
